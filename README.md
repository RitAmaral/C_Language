# C Language

C is a procedural programming language, which means it follows a top-down approach where a program is divided into functions or procedures.
This language is widely used in various domains, including operating systems, embedded systems, game development, and application software.

Low-level programming: C provides direct access to memory addresses and hardware, making it well-suited for system-level programming and embedded systems.

Pointers: C allows the use of pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses. Pointers are powerful but require careful handling to avoid memory-related bugs.
